# HTML, CSS, JS SBA

## Summary
  I made the first few pages of my capstone project.  This website will be a convienient way to store important life events that forgetful people can reference it for dates and other notes about events.  I used bootstrap for the majority of my styling since I have made about a dozen projects with HTML, CSS, JS.  I created this page to just handle basic dummy data and not require loging in.  
  When you go to the login page you can, no need to type anything in you can just click log in to go to the main user page. However, if you type in an email it will use regex to verify that it is a valid email address.
